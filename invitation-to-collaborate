Hello!

There's a number of forks of this project, it would be excellent if we could find a way to collaborate to pool our efforts.

e.g. Has anyone tried building the DOS wrappers? Or adding some automated tests?

There's a GH discussion page here that I'm letting people know about, would be great to see you there!
